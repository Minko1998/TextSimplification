Intelligent Public Transportation Systems (IPTS) are making contribution to better transport efficiency and energy user, as well as assisting travelers to have better experience while taking public transportation services. Existing literature paid more attention to the technical aspect around this topic, while left the user side not being examined thoroughly. The current study aimed to reconstruct user travel chains and to build a scenario-based user journey map for IPTS usage in the city of Shanghai. We approached this objective by conducting a combination of methods, including field observation, diary entries and in-depth interviews. Travelers’ behaviors, perceptions and needs were analyzed at each stage of the trip. Findings showed that IPTS are making it easier for people to travel with public transportation services, but meanwhile there are problems unsolved. Travelers want to have more control and certainty about their trips, but these needs cannot be guaranteed via travel assisting tools, especially when the trip is complicated with multiple transfers or even multiple means of transportation. Besides, people’s dependency on mobile trip planner and navigator seem to be high, which could lead to anxiety about not having enough mobile phone battery. 
Politik und Demokratie interessant, spannend und herausfordernd prasentieren, Burger zur Meinungsbildung und -auserung motivieren. Das sind die Ziele von DEMOS (Delphi Mediation Online System), einer Internet-basierten Diskussions- und Informationsplattform, die im Rahmen eines von der EU geforderten Projekts entwickelt wurde. Ein moglichst breites Spektrum an Benutzergruppen soll mit einer ubersichtlichen, leicht bedienbaren und grafisch attraktiven Benutzungsoberflache den Einstieg in die ?-Demokratie finden und sich in politische Fragestellungen und Entscheidungen einbringen. 
In the project inDAgo several demonstrators for helping elderly people in their mobility were developed. User research results showed an aversion to conspicuous assistive products. Thus the project focused on developing demonstrators with the appearance of invisible companions. The autonomous demonstrators were built in a ubiquitous, adaptive environment. This paper shows an extract of these products and describes their acceptance in the target group. 
Positive user experience is an essential precondition for making online technologies accessible for elderly users. The V2me team chose to develop along an iterative user-centered design process (UCD) in order to focus on the target group’s needs and limitations. Interviews with potential users and workshops with professionals were conducted and requirements were derived from the gathered knowledge on the target group. Further the V2me team designed an interaction and screen design, made these concepts experienceable in a first demonstrator and conducted a usability study with potential users. 
Online-Dienste, die zur Unterstutzung eines selbstorganisierten und selbstbestimmten Lebens von Menschen, die auf die Unterstutzung anderer bei der Bewaltigung ihres alltaglichen Lebens angewiesen sind, werden als Tele-Assistenzsysteme bezeichnet. Das Design eines solchen Systems und welche Auswirkungen die kontex-tuellen Bedingungen fur den Einsatz des Systems auf das Design hatten, wird im Folgenden beschrieben. 
Web design is still primarily an artistic endeavor. However, we are beginning to see empirical research results that tell us what pitfalls to avoid in order to create successful web sites.In this SIG, we will discuss the latest research results available. Web-site designers can share successful strategies and discuss questions still unanswered.This SIG also will be a forum for researchers to discuss methods and share objectives. Researchers will have an opportunity to interact with web-site designers to understand the research still required to identify the keys to successful design.Following the session, we intend to consolidate the discussion into a four-to-five page summary and send it to all participants. 
This paper presents best practices of how to design reminder objects. Reminder objects are digitally augmented everyday objects which break down and communicate complex information via sensory input and output.   In the first section of this paper, we introduce reminder objects --what they are and how they work.   We describe our understanding of computing and the interaction between humans and technology in detail in the second section. In section three, we present our vision how reminder objects can enrich the useru0027s experience by combining different objects.   We show corresponding examples of our work in this field in the two following sections. Two scenarios -- checking the weather and navigating the city -- will illustrate our understanding of reminder objects.   The paper concludes with a discussion of the presented work and an outlook about the future of reminder objects. 
This paper is presenting a new software application, which supports activities for user experience professionals. We call this application "UX Office". The application is based on key learnings: 1. Many activities of user experience professionals follow a similar structure and process. 2. User experience activities are very often done in a collaborative way between clients and user experience service providers. 3. Project information is used in several stages of the project and some project information is even being reused in other project. 4. The quality of outcomes between user experience service providers varies sometimes quite a lot. The UX Office is addressing these observations and providing support for user experience professionals. The paper describes some background information and how the UX Office deals with the observations. The UX Office makes the professional life of user experience experts easier, is cost efficient, enriches the result quality of outcomes and allows collaboration between clients and service providers. 

We observed the same task executed by 49 users on four production web sites. We tracked the rates of discovery of new usability problems on each site and, using that data, estimated the total number of usability problems on each site and the number of tests we would need to discover every problem. Our findings differ sharply from rules-of-thumb derived from earlier work by Virzi[1] and Nielsen[2,3] commonly viewed as "industry standards." We found that the four sites we studied would need considerably more than five users to find 85% of the problems 
The FeelMouse supports the user by providing tactile and force feedback to the user. Depending on the object the user points to the force necessary to press the mouse button differs. With more or less resistance the user perceives harder or softer objects or objects which jut out more or less from the virtual computer surface. If the force is switched continuously a vibrating object is generated. In addition to “normal” usage the FeelMouse can be used to enable the work with GUIu0027s also for visually impaired people. 
The Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) is presented as an approach to analyse and evaluate the user-perceived "character" of web site designs. The RGT reveals the participantsu0027 personal perceptions and preferences. This information supports the design of an appealing user experience. 
The vision of user experience is making life of users of products as convenient as possible, especially during the interaction with a productor a service. An important aspect of perceived convenience is the user experience of a product. The visual design and especially the interaction design has a major influence on this perception. In order to achieve the vision, user experience experts apply different types of tasks. One type of task is to analyze how users carry out tasks and what useru0027s needs or problems are. Another type of task is to design user experience solutions and other typical task type deals with carrying out usability evaluations in order to find problems in using software application. In the course of user experience activities, many data are being collected. Many of the collected data relates to certain activities of users. For the user experience area there exist just a few tools, which support typical tasks in different ways. None of the tools supports linking results of user experience work to user experience meta-data. Why is it a problem? The current tools do not support an access to user experience project data with generic search and filter criteria like "industry", "application area", "use case" etc. This makes the access to user experience research data difficult and the comparison of user experience project data between different projects inefficient. In general, results of different user experience projects are difficult to reuse. The core idea of data pattern for allocating user experience Meta-Data to User Experience research data is to associate user experience project data with user experience meta-data. The data pattern considers associating user experience project data with user experience meta-data partially automatically and partially manually by the user. The key idea is that we want to reuse project data like the project sponsor, the application area, the industry, use cases etc. as user experience meta-data and assign them to user experience research data. The benefits of the data pattern are: Reusing results of user experience research projects. Making access to available results more efficient. Direct comparison of available results is supported and more efficient. UX Office is the typical instance for application. 
This paper presents a novel pointing system for distant displays based on an acoustic position estimation technique in conjunction with a gravity sensor on a smartphone. The system is designed to interact with a distant large display such as a television set at home or digital signage in public. The system consists of a display, two loudspeakers set around the display, and a smartphone as a pointing device containing a microphone and a gravity sensor inside. The position of the pointer is theoretically determined by the position and direction of the smartphone, given by the three-dimensional acoustic position estimation. This smartphone-based system approximates the position and direction by the two-dimensional position of the microphone horizontally and the pitch angle from the gravity sensor vertically. The loudspeakers of the prototype system radiate burst signals of 20 kHz modulated by pre-windowed M-sequence, which are reproducible by normal television sets. The position of the smartphone is estimated at a frame rate of 23 Hz, and the pointer is rendered at a frame rate of over 100 Hz with linear interpolation and with a latency of 0.4 second. 
The present study examines the role of subjectively perceived ergonomic quality (e.g. simplicity, controllability) and hedonic quality (e.g. novelty, originality) of a software system in forming a judgement of appeal. A hypothesised research model is presented. The two main research question are: (1) Are ergonomic and hedonic quality subjectively different quality aspects that can be independently perceived by the users? and (2) Is the judgement of appeal formed by combining and weighting ergonomic and hedonic quality and which weights are assigned?  The results suggest that both quality aspects can be independently perceived by users. Moreover, they almost equally contributed to the appeal of the tested software prototypes. A simple averaging model implies that both quality aspects will compensate each other.  Limitations and practical implication of the results are discussed.
